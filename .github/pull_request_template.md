## Checklist before opening a PR

- [ ] I am opening a pull request against the `main` branch of the `2025` repo.
- [ ] My post and all associated references to it are all **lowercase**, i.e

        2025-04-28-Sample-Test.md               -> 2025-04-28-sample-test.md
        assets/img/2025-04-28-Sample-Test/ 	-> assets/img/2025-04-28-sample-test/
- [ ] The title of my PR is exactly the name of my markdown file
    - i.e. `_posts/2025-04-28-[submission-name].md` would require a PR name `2025-04-28-[submission-name]` 
- [ ] I have **anonymized** my post: my author's list is `Anonymous`, and there is no potential
    content which can reveal my/my collaborators identities.
- [ ] My post matches the formatting requirements, including (but not limited to):
    - [ ] I have **ONLY MODIFIED** files in the following locations (failure to do so will result in 
        your PR automatically being closed!):
        - a Markdown (or HTML) file in `_posts/` with the format `_posts/2025-04-28-[submission-name].md` (or `.html`)
        - static image assets added to `assets/img/2025-04-28-[submission-name]/`
        - interactive HTML figures added  to `assets/html/2025-04-28-[submission-name]/`
        - citations in a bibtex file in `assets/bibliography/2025-04-28-[submission-name].bib`
    - [ ] I have a short 2-3 sentence abstract in the `description` field of my front-matter 
    - [ ] I have a table of contents, formatted using the `toc` field of my front-matter
    - [ ] My bibliography is correctly formatted, using a `.bibtex` file as per the sample post
